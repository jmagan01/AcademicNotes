Logistic regression is a useful tool to model the probability of the dependent variable to belong to a particular (binary) category. Thus, logistic regression is part of the group of techniques typically used for classification problems. More formally, logistic regression models the relationship between $p(X) = Pr(Y=1|X)$, where $p(X)$ denotes the the probability for $Y$ to be True given a specific value of $X$.

You might wonder why not to use linear regression instead where $p(X) = {\beta_0} + {\beta_1} X$, this is a valid question however this function is of little help to make predictions about the category of a variable given that it's codomain includes the all the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ from $-{\infty}$ to ${\infty}$. That is $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. How would you interpret a negative probability? what would be the meaning of a very large probability number such as 9000%? 

In classification problems we are interested on predicting if an event will happen or not, if an individual belogs to group A or group B, or whether the market will move downward or upward, all those are examples of binary classification problems for which we need a mathematical function which output ranges between 0 and 1 for all the domain of $X$, more formally $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto (0,1)$. In other words the output value is always a probability between 0 and 1. One of the functions that satisfy this condition is the logistic function defined below:

$$p(X) = \frac{e^{{\beta_0} + {\beta_1} X}}{1+e^{{\beta_0} + {\beta_1} X}}$$
, which can also be expressed as follows:

$$\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)} = e^{{\beta_0} + {\beta_1} X}$$
The left side of the equation above is also known as *the odds*
