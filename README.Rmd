## Data Science Handbook

Welcome to the 'Data Science Handbook' project. 

This is the very first version of a collection of notes aimed to capture the basics of the methods and techniques from the areas of Predictive Analytics and Data Science. We focus on the domains of Finance and Econometrics. We employ **R** language to code all our sample scripts.
